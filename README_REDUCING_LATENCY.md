## 1. Set USB Latency Timer (Quickest)

To set the latency timer of the USB serial device to 1ms, use the following command:

 **Set the Latency Timer**:
 ```bash
 sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer'
 ```

 **Verify the Latency Timer**:
 Check that the latency timer has been set to 1ms:
 ```bash
 cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
 ```



> :warning: **That this will have to be done every time you reboot.**

## 2. USB Scheduling and CPU Affinity

Optimizing USB scheduling and setting CPU affinity can help prioritize USB interrupts and reduce latency.

### USB Scheduling

Prioritize USB data transfers by adjusting the USB scheduling settings.

 **Authorize USB Default**:
 ```bash
 sudo sh -c 'echo 2 > /sys/class/usb_host/usb_host1/authorized_default'
 ```
 Adjust the path and value as needed for your specific USB host.

### CPU Affinity

Setting CPU affinity for USB interrupts ensures that the USB processing is handled by a specific CPU core, reducing latency.

 **Identify IRQ for USB**:
 Find the IRQ number for your USB device:
 ```bash
 cat /proc/interrupts | grep -i usb
 ```
 Note the IRQ number for your USB device.

 **Set CPU Affinity**:
 Bind the IRQ to a specific CPU core:
 ```bash
 sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/irq/<IRQ_NUMBER>/smp_affinity_list'
 ```
 Replace `<IRQ_NUMBER>` with the actual IRQ number. This example binds the IRQ to CPU core 0.

## 3. Optimize Power Management Settings

Disabling certain power management features can reduce latency spikes caused by power state changes.

### Powertop Tool

`powertop` is a tool that can help you tune power management settings to achieve better performance.

 **Install Powertop**:
 ```bash
 sudo apt-get install powertop
 ```

 **Run Powertop**:
 Start `powertop` in interactive mode to analyze current power consumption and suggest optimizations:
 ```bash
 sudo powertop
 ```

 **Apply Auto-Tune**:
 Automatically apply all suggested optimizations:
 ```bash
 sudo powertop --auto-tune
 ```

### Manual Power Management Adjustments

You can manually adjust power management settings by echoing specific values into sysfs.

 **Disable USB Autosuspend**:
 ```bash
 sudo sh -c 'echo on > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb*/power/control'
 ```

 **Disable CPU Idle States**:
 Prevent CPUs from entering deeper idle states, which can reduce latency:
 ```bash
 sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/disable'
 ```

## 4. Real-Time Kernel

A real-time (RT) kernel is optimized to handle tasks requiring low latency and high determinism. It reduces the maximum latency for interrupt handling and task switching.

### Installing a Real-Time Kernel

 **Install the RT Kernel**:
 ```bash
 sudo apt-get install linux-image-rt
 ```

 **Reboot into the RT Kernel**:
 After installation, reboot your system and select the RT kernel from your bootloader (GRUB).

 **Verify RT Kernel**:
 Check that you are running the RT kernel:
 ```bash
 uname -r
 ```
 You should see a kernel version ending with `-rt`.
