# Robotous_FT_RFT60
Catkin code to interface RFT60-HA01 sensor via catkin workspace to a ros node

One of the most important tools to learn before starting your journey of making and building different stacks is:
1. Rosdep: http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep
2. Synaptic
3. If ROS has been setup from source then never forget to source ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash.
4. It can be directly added to the path (~./bashrc) via the command : echo 'source ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
5. and then simply source ~/.bashrc would source everything added to that file.
